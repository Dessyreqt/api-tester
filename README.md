# api-tester
Basic scaffolding for testing an API via .NET code rather than using Postman or Insomnia. Created for illustrative purposes.

This is written to test my `BaseApi` repo and illustrate how simple API tests can be written in minimal time with minimal coding knowledge using a few easy-to-use libraries to get the code running quickly. This took me about 15 minutes to write the first version. :D
